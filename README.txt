Just a simple book management page with the addition of a review mechanism and custom vaadin elements including a custom book grid,
I have also included a web scraper that scans the good reads book website and pulls the books - decription name author and book cover.
This means that the database is updated with new books every 12 hours so the database can keep growing.
